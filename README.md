🚦 AI-Powered Traffic Management System

📌 Overview

Modern cities are grappling with increasing traffic congestion, leading to delays, pollution, and frustration for commuters. Traditional traffic light systems operate on fixed timers, making them inefficient during fluctuating traffic conditions.

This project introduces an AI-driven Traffic Management System that dynamically analyzes traffic conditions from images and adjusts traffic signal timings accordingly. By uploading a snapshot of the current traffic scenario, the system recommends optimal durations for red and green lights based on real-time vehicle density.

🎯 Features

- 📷 Upload Traffic Image: Easily upload a photo of the current traffic situation.
- 🧠 AI-Powered Analysis: Detects vehicle density using an AI model trained on traffic images.
- 🕒 Dynamic Signal Timing: Suggests intelligent red and green light durations based on traffic load.
- 📊 Improves Traffic Efficiency: Reduces congestion and wait times dynamically.

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍  
- OpenCV 📸  
- TensorFlow / Keras 🤖  
- Streamlit / Flask 🌐 (for frontend interface)
- NumPy / Pandas for data processing

 📸 How It Works

1. Capture Image: Take a photo of the intersection showing the upcoming traffic.
2. Upload Image: Use the application interface to upload the image.
3. Traffic Density Analysis: The AI model processes the image to determine the vehicle count and traffic density.
4. Signal Timing Suggestion: Based on the analysis, the system suggests optimal durations for red and green lights.

 🚀 Future Scope

- Real-time integration with CCTV feeds for live traffic management.
- Predictive analytics for traffic forecasting.
- Multi-intersection control systems.
- Emergency vehicle priority detection.
